# 🛒 Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis  
**📊 Data Analytics Project | Python • SQL • Power BI**

---

## 🔍 Overview
In this project, I implemented an end-to-end data analytics workflow to analyze customer shopping behavior. I worked across the complete analytics lifecycle, including data ingestion, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL-based querying, business intelligence dashboard development, and reporting.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in data analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL querying, business intelligence, and data visualization, aligning my skill set with **Data Analyst**, **Business Analyst**, and **BI Analyst** roles.

I worked with a structured customer transaction dataset containing:
- Customer demographics  
- Purchase frequency and spending behavior  
- Product and category details  

**Format:** CSV  
**File:** `customer_shopping_behavior.csv`

## 🔄 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Ingestion & Preparation
- Loaded raw CSV data into Python using Pandas  
- Validated schema, data types, and overall data quality  

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Handled missing values and duplicate records  
- Standardized column names and data formats  
- Prepared clean datasets for analysis and SQL ingestion  

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Performed statistical and descriptive analysis  
- Analyzed customer segmentation and purchasing trends  
- Visualized insights using charts and plots  

**Notebook:** `customer_shopping_behaviour_python_analysis.ipynb`

---

### 4️⃣ SQL Analytics
- Loaded the cleaned customer shopping dataset into a relational database (PostgreSQL)  
- Wrote and executed SQL queries to perform:
  - Customer-wise purchase and spending analysis  
  - Category-wise sales and performance analysis  
  - Aggregations using `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, and `GROUP BY`  
  - Filtering using `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `HAVING` clauses  
- Used SQL to validate insights generated during Python-based EDA  

**File:** `customer_shopping_behavior_sql_queires.sql`

---

### 5️⃣ Business Intelligence Dashboard (Power BI)
- Imported the cleaned dataset into Power BI and created a structured data model  
- Developed interactive dashboards to analyze:
  - Customer distribution and segmentation  
  - Category-wise and product-wise performance  
  - Spending patterns and purchase trends  
- Implemented slicers and filters to enable dynamic analysis by customer attributes and product categories  
- Designed visuals to support stakeholder-friendly insight consumption and decision-making  

**Dashboard:** `customer_shopping_behavior_bi.pbix`

---

### 6️⃣ Reporting & Presentation
- Created a detailed analytics report summarizing key findings  
- Built a professional presentation using Gamma to communicate insights  
- Exported reports and presentations as PDF for easy sharing  

---

## 📈 Key Results & Business Insights
- Identified high-value customer segments based on spending behavior  
- Highlighted top-performing product categories  
- Discovered meaningful spending and purchasing patterns  
- Generated insights to support data-driven marketing and sales strategies
